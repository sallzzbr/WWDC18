 Welcome to my musical Playground,
 I always loved music, but I am really bad playing any instrument or singing.
 Thanks to technology I can play some music, I hope you enjoy it as I do.
 
 **PLEASE RUN THIS BOOK ON A LANDSCAPE POSITION**
 
 Just click on any musical note to start your own orchestra!
 
 **The left hand** will slide up and down, with it you can control the volume of the last selected instrument.
 Move it up to increase the volume and down to decrease it.
 
 **The right hand** will slide sideways, with it you can control the music rate.
 Move it to the left to increase the rate, to the right to decrease.
 
 **The notes are**
 
 A = La /
 B = Si /
 C = Do /
 D = Re /
 E = Mi /
 F = Fa /
 G = Sol /
 
 Ps: my favourite song is Brothers in Arms - Dire Straits, maybe you can play it for me. 
 
 Have fun, Maestro!
