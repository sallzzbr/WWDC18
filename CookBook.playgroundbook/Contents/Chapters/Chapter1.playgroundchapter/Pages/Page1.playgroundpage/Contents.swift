 Welcome to my CookBook,
 
 programming and cooking have a lot in common:
 
 1- I love doing both
 2- Are essential skills
 3- Have different recipes and methods
 4- Have their own rules, but allow you to create and be creative
 5- Are among my favorite things
 
 This are just few examples.
 
 So why not adding both together? Lets create the CookLanguage and cook/program together!
 
 In the end you will know a bit of cooking, programming and of myself.
