 Welcome to my CookBook,
 
 Cooking is a essential skill, so is programming nowadays and for the future. They have a lot of things in common,
 coding is like putting a recipe together, the way you choose to run your code can affect your result just like how you cook your food can.
 
 Any programming language has specific rules that will allow you to create and be creative. The same is truth with cooking, you can try anything!
 But mix the wrong ingredients and maybe your food won't be tasty or your code won't work as planned.

 This playgroundbook is about cooking, programming and me. I've added a few ingredients and cooking methods on the next page. This are ingredients from my
 favorite recipes, feel free to guess them, try some variants or create entire new things!
 
 In the end you will learn a bit of cooking, programming and of me. Go to the next page and enjoy yourself!
