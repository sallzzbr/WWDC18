 The beauty about cooking and programming is that you can try different formulas for the same product. There are different recipes for a bread or a fried egg, also for an app. I could've done this playgroundBook with different frameworks.
 Sometimes you will only know wich option is better after doing and testing it. When I learn a knew recipe I am always eager to learn new ones. I hope this book open your appetite for good food, knowledge and programming.
 Best regards,
 PS: I added my favourite recipes here(Cheesecake, eggs, lemon mousse,  brazilian carrot cake and apple pie), but there are many possibilities, some that I couldn't predict feel free to create and inovate! **You can find the documentation of the CookLanguage on the next page!**
